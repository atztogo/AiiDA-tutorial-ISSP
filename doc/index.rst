AiiDA tutorial at ISSP of Univ. Tokyo
=====================================

A two days AiiDA tutorial will be held at ISSP of the university
Tokyo on 19, 20th of December 2019.

Plan
----

This is a training session to feel AiiDA
(http://www.aiida.net/). People who want to join will get together by
themselves. No financial support will be provided from this tutorial
organizers. At this time, the number of participants will have to be kept
minimum because we don't have enough people to support
participants. In the future in Japan, we hope we will have a larger
AiiDA tutorial with more supporters.

In the hands-on tutorial, we will basically follow the `previous AiiDA
tutorial material
<https://aiida-tutorials.readthedocs.io/en/latest/pages/2019_IIT_Mandi_India/index.html>`_
(we will modify this material a little). Participants are requested to
bring their own laptop computers with virtualbox installed and to
setup `Quantum Mobile
<https://materialscloud.org/work/quantum-mobile>`_. Then they will run
their hands-on tutorials on their own computers.
